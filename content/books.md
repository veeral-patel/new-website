Here are some books I've read that I highly recommend.

## Product

- [The Mom Test](https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone-ebook/dp/B01H4G2J1U/) - If you ask potential users what they think of your product, they'll mislead you. Fitzpatrick teaches you how to learn if the user has the problem you're trying to solve, without mentioning your product at all.

- [Inspired](https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers-ebook/dp/B077NRB36N/) - Most companies build products in the same (bad) way, which is just writing up a product roadmap and building it. The best teams, though, understand the user, ideate, and prototype and validate ideas before putting them on the roadmap.

## Biographies

- [At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA](https://www.amazon.com/At-Center-Storm-Years-CIA/dp/0061147788) - I always wondered what exactly an "intelligence agency" did. This book by the second longest serving CIA director describes, among many other things, how the CIA cajoled (and bullied) Afghani tribes
  into fighting the Taliban.
