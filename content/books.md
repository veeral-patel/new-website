Here are some books I've read that I highly recommend.

## Product

- [The Mom Test](https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone-ebook/dp/B01H4G2J1U/) - If you ask potential users what they think of your product, they'll mislead you. Fitzpatrick teaches you how to learn if the user has the problem you're trying to solve, without mentioning your product at all.

- [Inspired](https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers-ebook/dp/B077NRB36N/) - Most companies build products in the same (bad) way, which is just writing up a product roadmap and building it. The best teams, though, understand the user, ideate, and prototype and validate ideas before putting them on the roadmap.

- [When Coffee and Kale Compete](https://www.amazon.com/When-Coffee-Kale-Compete-products-ebook/dp/B07C7HH662/) - Segmenting users based on jobs-to-be-done, not personas, teaches you who your real competitors are and how to improve your product in the user's eyes.

- [Escaping the Build Trap](https://www.amazon.com/Escaping-Build-Trap-Effective-Management/dp/149197379X) - Shipping more code doesn't mean providing more value to users. Also taught me how to go about PM in a systematic way: understand the company's goals, understand your product's current state, choose something to improve, ideate, and experiment.

## Biographies

- [At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA](https://www.amazon.com/At-Center-Storm-Years-CIA/dp/0061147788) - Written by George Tenet, CIA director under Presidents Clinton and GWB. I especially liked learning how the CIA cajoled (and bullied) Afghani tribes into helping overthrow the Taliban.

- [Who is Michael Ovitz?](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Is-Michael-Ovitz-audiobook/dp/B07DK2XMBZ) - Michael Ovitz built the largest talent agency in Hollywood, with virtually all the A list stars, by creating a network effect: he'd package directors, actors, and the script, moving power from the studios to his agency. Later, he helped broker multi-billion dollar M&A deals and became president of Disney.
