Welcome! I live in Sunnyvale, CA and work as a fullstack software engineer at [OpsRamp](https://opsramp.com). I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Computer Science degree in December 2018.

Previously I worked as an incident response consultant at [Mandiant](https://www.fireeye.com/mandiant.html), and interned on [Yelp's](https://yelp.com) Application Security team.
