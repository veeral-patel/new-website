Welcome! I live in Sunnyvale, CA and work as a fullstack software engineer at [OpsRamp](https://opsramp.com). I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Computer Science degree in December 2018 (decided to graduate a little early, in 2.5 years).

Previously I worked as an incident response consultant at [Mandiant](https://www.fireeye.com/mandiant.html), and interned on [Yelp's](https://yelp.com) Application Security team.

Reach me at [veeralpatel4@gmail.com](mailto:veeralpatel4@gmail.com).

## Projects

- [CISO/Founder Connect](http://connect.securityfounders.org/) - project I'm working on with [Caleb Sima](https://www.linkedin.com/in/calebsima) (CISO at Robinhood). Matches CISOs and founders with each other for angel investing, product feedback, advising, board seats. Fortunate to have some top notch security leaders in the program from great companies including JupiterOne, Redis Labs, Twilio, Google DeepMind, Informatica, and many more.

- [Learn Security Engineering](https://github.com/veeral-patel/learn-security-engineering) (6k stars) - 20+ pages of my notes on how to build secure systems, along with 25+ papers and 15+ book recommendations. The most starred repository [on this topic on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/security-engineering) (as of July 2020).

- [Awesome Risk Quantification](https://github.com/veeral-patel/awesome-risk-quantification) (350+ stars) - The most popular collection on GitHub of projects, blog posts, books, and talks about cybersecurity risk quantification

- [Orchestrator](http://web.archive.org/web/20181211032349/http://getorchestrator.com/) - an (unsuccessful) security automation startup I founded in college. Interviewed at Y Combinator twice, but never got in.

- [True Positive](https://github.com/veeral-patel/true-positive) - open source, collaborative, web-based case management tool for incident response

- [Incidents](https://github.com/veeral-patel/incidents) - initial iteration of True Positive. Written with Rails with server-rendered HTML and JQuery, then later rewrote True Positive using a Rails API and React, revamping the UI and adding many more features

- [LR Tracker](https://github.com/veeral-patel/lr_tracker) - a simple web app I built at Mandiant to help me track my forensic analyses of different compromised computers

- While in college, had the opportunity to participate in a US-UK CTF competition held at the University of Cambridge in the UK. [Managed to place 2nd individually](https://sa.berkeley.edu/news/2017/10/13/cal-sophomore-veeral-patel-places-2nd-cyber-security-competition) (110 competitors total, from 24 colleges)

- [ConsoleMe](http://github.com/netflix/consoleme) - made a (tiny) contribution by skimming through the codebase and [summarizing the file structure in the CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/Netflix/consoleme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), to onboard new contributors faster
