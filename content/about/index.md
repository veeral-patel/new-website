Welcome! I live in Sunnyvale, CA and work as a fullstack software engineer at [OpsRamp](https://opsramp.com). I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Computer Science degree in December 2018 (in 2.5 years).

Previously I worked as an incident response consultant at [Mandiant](https://www.fireeye.com/mandiant.html), and interned on [Yelp's](https://yelp.com) Application Security team.

Reach me at [veeralpatel4@gmail.com](mailto:veeralpatel4@gmail.com).

## Projects

The most starred repository [on this topic on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/security-engineering) (as of July 2020).
